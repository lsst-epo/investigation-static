  "content": "<p>Every so often you hear in the news about an asteroid that is passing close to Earth. Or maybe youâ€™ve seen a movie about a killer asteroid headed our way, with catastrophic consequences if it hits us. Are there asteroids out there that might hit us? How do astronomers find them? And what would happen if one hit us?</p><p>Early detection of an asteroid that may pose a threat to Earth allows scientists more time to accurately determine its orbit and properties, and then choose the most effective intervention strategy. Vera C. Rubin Observatory excels at discovering new asteroids because it monitors large areas of the sky every night and can detect very dim moving objects. In this investigation you will learn how to decide if an asteroid poses a threat to hit Earth, and how much damage an impact could cause. Then you will have the opportunity to evaluate the risk from an asteroid recently discovered by Rubin Observatory.</p><h3>Essential Questions</h3><ul><li>What factors determine if an asteroid could hit Earth?</li><li>What is needed to accurately define the orbit of a newly-discovered solar system object?</li><li>What factors determine the amount of damage from an asteroid impact?</li></ul>"
