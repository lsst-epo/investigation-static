However, astronomers can make color images from the light transmitted by ultraviolet or infrared filters by assigning a color to the image taken through these filters. Filters that transmit light over a range of wavelengths from ultraviolet to visible to infrared are used to investigate objects or areas of interest. Here are some examples:</p><h2>Seeing through dust</h2> <p>The LSST Camera uses near-infrared filters that make it possible to see through dust. Near-infrared wavelengths of light are not deflected by dust, unlike shorter and longer wavelengths. Filters that transmit light in near-infrared wavelengths are also excellent for detecting faint red stars.</p><p>Let’s see how this works: The Ghost Nebula is a dense cloud of gas and dust. If the Ghost Nebula was observed using visible light alone, many of the stars within it would be hidden from view.</p>",

(There’s a particular reason that these colors are arranged in this order—more on this later.) Then the final full color image was color balanced.</p>",
