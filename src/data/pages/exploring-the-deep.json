This image shows thousands of galaxies of different sizes, brightnesses, and colors. Clicking on a galaxy will add a data point to the plot. Be sure you select enough galaxies so that your data spans the entire range of distances along the x-axis on the plot (to accomplish this you will need to select some very small and faint galaxies). Select at least 40 galaxies.</p>",
