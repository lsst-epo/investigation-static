  "content": "<p>The Rubin Observatory LSST Camera contains six filters (Figure 6), identified by the letters u, g, r, i, z and y. Four of these filters (u, g, r, and i) transmit some visible light our eyes can see. The u filter also transmits ultraviolet light. The z and y filters transmit only infrared light. As you can see, these filters transmit light over a broader range of wavelengths and are not limited to just one color of light. You can remember these filters in their correct order from short wavelengths to long wavelengths by using the mnemonic “U-Grizy”.</p>",
