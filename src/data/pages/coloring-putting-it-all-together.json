Why? (Note: you must use at least two filters.)</li><li>Develop your chromatic ordering sequence.</li></ul><p>To get started:<ul><li>Use the Astronomical Color Mixing Tool to select an object from the list.</li><li>For each of the filters you wish to use, start by turning on each filter and selecting colors.</li><li>Adjust the sliders to enhance the image. Think about color-balancing the image so it clearly shows the areas or objects you wish to study.</li><li><strike>If needed, you can open up additional windows to compare different filters or different objects in the same filter by clicking on the “add a window” sign in the upper right.</strike></li><li><strike>You may wish to use the drawing tool to mark a place on the image where you have identified an object, or where you wish to direct a comment.</strike></li></ul></p>",
