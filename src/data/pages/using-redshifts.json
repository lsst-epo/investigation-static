  "content": "<p>Rubin Observatory measures the brightness of a galaxy through multiple filters over a range of wavelengths. The galaxy's light through different filters is then compared to a set of models to determine how much the galaxy's light has been shifted to longer wavelengths, or redshifted. This technique produces a redshift value that is referred to as <a href='http://rubineducation.org/glossary/photometric-redshift' target='_blank'>photometric redshift</a> (Z). A mathematical relationship is then used to calculate the recessional velocity (v) of the galaxy from its photometric redshift (Z). The larger the galaxyâ€™s photometric redshift, the faster the galaxy appears to be moving away from us.</p><p>Using this technique, Rubin Observatory will make a dramatic increase in the amount of redshift data for faint galaxies beyond what has previously been collected.</p>",
