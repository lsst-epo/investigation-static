They will then point their telescope at this location and take a series of pictures. If the asteroid is there, it will be noticeable because the asteroidâ€™s position will change from picture to picture. Astronomers will then measure the location of the asteroid in each picture, and will record the time when each picture was taken.</p><p>Suppose you are an asteroid specialist at another observatory doing follow-up observations of a new asteroid that Rubin Observatory has discovered. You are in charge of deciding where the next observation should be made.</p><p>The map below shows the actual location of the asteroid for the three previous observations, the possible orbits of the asteroid, and four possible observing locations (A, B, C and D) for the asteroid. </p>",
