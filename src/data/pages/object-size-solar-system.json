  "content": "<p>Sometimes itâ€™s useful to know the size of an object. Consider the case for asteroid mining: a large asteroid would produce more raw materials, and therefore have a higher economic potential. Or what if a newly discovered object seems to be on a collision course with Earth? Knowing its size would help us to predict the potential damage it could cause. The size is also a critical factor in determining what sort of strategy we would use to deflect the object.</p><p>Even through the most powerful telescopes on Earth, asteroids and TNOs are too far away to look like anything bigger than dots in an image. However, we can use the brightness of the object in an image to estimate its size. Complete this   statement, using your reasoning abilities:</p>",
