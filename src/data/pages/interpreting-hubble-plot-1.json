  "content": "<p>You will begin by investigating four images of galaxies that contain supernovae. Your job is to identify the location of the galaxy and its companion supernova in each image.</p> <p>The distances to the Type Ia supernovae and their host galaxies, have already been determined. Supernova distances are measured in megaparsecs (Mpc). One megaparsec corresponds to a distance of roughly 3.3 million light years. Remember, because each supernova is in a galaxy, the distances to the supernova and the galaxy are the same. Clicking on the supernova will add the corresponding distance to the table.</p> <p>The recessional velocities of these galaxies have been determined by using photometric redshift. Galaxy recessional velocities are measured in kilometers per second (km/s). Clicking on the galaxy will add the corresponding distance to the table. </p><p>Later in this investigation you will use the data for your four galaxies to create a Hubble plot.</p> ",
