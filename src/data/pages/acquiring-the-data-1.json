The images on this page show a supernova discovered in a galaxy. Can you find it? When you spot the supernova, click on it. If you have identified it correctly, a green circle will appear around it.  Then click SAVE in the question below.</p><p>While the supernova can be used to find the distance to the galaxy, the brightness of the galaxy image (measured over a range of wavelengths) can be used to determine the galaxy’s redshift, which can be then used to calculate the recessional velocity of the galaxy.</p><p>Identify the center of the host galaxy by clicking on it. A yellow circle should appear when you have correctly located the galaxy. Then click SAVE in the second question below.</p><p>Wth the values for galaxy distance and recessional velocity, you can construct your own Hubble plot.</p><p>When a Type Ia supernova explodes in a galaxy, we can use the peak luminosity of the supernova to determine the distance to the galaxy. And we can use the galaxy’s photometric redshift to determine its velocity away from us. With these two pieces of information, we can add the galaxy to a Hubble plot.</p>",
