Do this by selecting a color to the left of the sliders.</li><li>Now try to recreate the full-color image by adjusting the sliders to change the color intensity of the image. When the sliders are correctly placed, the image will be properly color balanced. If the colors in the image are not balanced, objects in the image (e.g., the shirts) will appear the wrong color. Color balance doesnâ€™t mean having the same intensity or amount of light for each filter.</li></ul>"
