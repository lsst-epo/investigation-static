This is known as the cosmological principle.</p><p>The cosmological principle doesnâ€™t mean that the Universe is exactly the same in all directions. Imagine that you are in the middle of a desert.  As you look around you in every direction, you see sand, rocks, mountains and maybe some plants. Not every mountain peak looks identical, and some places may have some more plants than others, but it is generally the same landscape.</p><p>Example: <a target='_blank' href='https://www.eso.org/public/hungary/images/uhd-img1312pv2-cc-eq-extended/?lang'>Atacama desert moving pan</a></p><p>Every person in your class has an LSST deep field image from different, random areas in the sky as viewed from Earth. Compare your image and plot to others from the class (or choose a few more fields from the list) to see if the patterns in your data agree with the patterns in their data sets and answer the following question:</p>",
