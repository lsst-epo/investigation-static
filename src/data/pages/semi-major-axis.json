Three properties used to describe an orbit are used throughout this investigation:</p><p>Orbital size is related to the orbit's <a href='http://rubineducation.org/glossary/semi-major-axis' target='_blank'>semi-major axis</a> (which is defined as half of the longest diameter of the object's orbit). It is measured in <a href='http://rubineducation.org/glossary/astronomical-unit-au' target='_blank'>astronomical units</a> (au). You can also think of the orbit's semi-major axis as its average distance from the Sun.</p>",
