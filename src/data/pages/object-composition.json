  "content": "<p>There are many different classes of asteroids. C-class (“carbonaceous”) asteroids are the most common, making up about 75% of all known asteroids. They are mostly made of clay and rock. These asteroids are of interest because they contain significant amounts of water, which future space explorers could use for life support and for the production of rocket fuel.</p><p>S-class (“silicaceous”) asteroids are the second most common, and make up about 17% of known asteroids. They contain large amounts of precious metals, such as gold, platinum, and iridium. Scientists estimate that some S-class asteroids have several trillion dollars worth of metals in them, which makes them of interest to potential mining operations.</p><p>We can learn about the composition of a Solar System object by measuring its brightness through multiple filters that transmit light over a limited range of wavelengths.</p><p>The Rubin Observatory’s LSST camera uses six filters to study the light from objects at different wavelengths. They are identified by the letters u, g, r, i, z and y. Three of these filters (g, r, and i) transmit visible light our eyes can see. The u filter transmits ultraviolet light.  The z and y filters transmit only infrared light.</p>",
