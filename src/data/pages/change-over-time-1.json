Astronomers can measure the distance to billions of galaxies using data from Rubin Observatory. Using the distances and position of galaxies, astronomers can create a map of the observable Universe that reveals this large-scale structure.</p><p>Here is a series of maps that show the galaxies detected by Rubin Observatory at certain distances away from Earth. The distances are expressed as redshift numbers. Lower redshift numbers are closer to Earth, and higher redshift numbers represent farther distances. Each map can be thought of as a view back to a particular time in the history of the Universeâ€”at greater distances we see the Universe as it was at earlier times.</p><p>Switch between the different redshift ranges to explore how the Universe has changed over time. Try zooming and dragging the maps for a closer look.</p>",
