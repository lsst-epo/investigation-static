Asteroids are discovered by detecting an object that has changed position in two or more pictures taken of a particular location in space. After the first night that it is discovered, additional observations need to be done to measure its speed and direction of motion.</p><p>Letâ€™s look at a typical asteroid. In this example, asteroid 2003_QZ30 was observed at three different times during the same night. Each time, the position of the asteroid was measured.</p>",
