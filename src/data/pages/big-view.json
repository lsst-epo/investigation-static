The more we identify and map the distribution of objects in our Solar System, the more we can learn about how it formed.</p><p>Most small Solar System objects fall into four categories:<ul><li><b>Main Belt Asteroids</b> (MBAs) - Objects that orbit the Sun between the orbits of Mars (1.5 AU) and Jupiter (5.2 AU).</li><li><b>Near-Earth objects</b> (NEOs) - Asteroids or comets whose orbit intersects the orbit of Earth.</li><li><b>Trans-Neptunian objects</b> (TNOs) - Objects that orbit the Sun at or beyond the orbit of Neptune, at a distance of about 30 AU and beyond. This area includes the Kuiper Belt and the entire region out to the inner Oort Cloud, which begins at approximately 2000 AU from the Sun.</li><li><b>Comets</b> - Icy objects found throughout the Solar System.</li></ul></p>"
