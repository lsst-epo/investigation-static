  "content": "<p>Have you ever wondered about the Universe? How did it begin? Has it changed over time? What will happen in the future? If you have, you’re not alone! For centuries scientists have been trying to answer these kinds of questions.</p><p>One hundred years ago, astronomer Edwin Hubble measured the distance to stars in the Andromeda Galaxy using a technique pioneered by Henrietta Leavitt. Hubble was surprised to discover that the Andromeda Galaxy was much farther away than all the stars and gas clouds in our galaxy, the Milky Way. His discovery made the size of the known Universe a whole lot larger!</p><p>But Hubble’s second discovery was even more revealing. Here’s the backstory:</p><p>Vesto Slipher had previously measured redshifts to some galaxies and discovered almost all of these galaxies were all moving away from us at astonishing speeds. Hubble and his assistant Milton Humason began to study more galaxies using Slipher’s technique, and then plotted the galaxy speeds vs. their distances. This type of graph is now known as a Hubble plot (see figure).<p/><p>The relationship shown is this plot illustrates that (with a few exceptions) nearby galaxies are moving away from us at speeds much slower than we see for more distant galaxies. Hubble’s observations provided strong evidence that the Universe is expanding, confirming the earlier theoretical models proposed by Albert Einstein and Georges Lemaitre).</p><p>When Hubble first made his diagram above, he only had data for galaxies relatively close to Earth. We can now see galaxies to the edge of the observable Universe.</p><p>LSST will detect more galaxies than seen by all previous telescopes. These observations will provide a more refined Hubble plot by adding many more data points, especially from very distant galaxies. </p><p>You will use these LSST data to discover how we know that the Universe is expanding, and how this expansion has changed over time. These observations can also be used as supporting evidence for the Big Bang Theory and the existence of dark energy.</p><h3>Essential Questions</h3><ul><li>How do we know that the Universe is expanding?</li><li>What do observations tell us about our place in the Universe?</li><li>How do we know that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating?</li><li>How does the observed expansion of the Universe support the Big Bang Theory?</li></ul>"
