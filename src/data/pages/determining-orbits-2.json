The addition of new data will rule out some of the possible orbits. Since Rubin Observatory will collect data from the entire sky every three to four nights, it will make it easier than ever for astronomers to detect new asteroids, make additional observations, and refine their orbits.</p><p>Here are the possible orbits of the asteroid after a third observation is made.</p>",
