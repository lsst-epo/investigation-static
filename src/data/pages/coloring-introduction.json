Nearly everything astronomers know about the stars and galaxies in the Universe comes from the light we receive from these objects. Fortunately, that light contains a wealth of information. In this investigation, you will learn how astronomers use light and filters to understand things such as distant galaxies, dusty nebulae, and types of stars.</p><h2>Essential Questions</h2><ul><li>How are filters used to create color images?</li><li>How are filters used to conduct astronomical research?</li><li>What can astronomers learn by using these filters?</li></ul>"
