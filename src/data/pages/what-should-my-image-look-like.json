In fact, there are many ways to create an image that will look quite different that correctly communicates a science message and may involve different choices of filters, chromatic ordering and color balancing. As long as you follow the three steps outlined on the previous page, an image would be considered “correct”.</p><p>Below are two different images of UGC12635 made using different filters, correct chromatic ordering sequences, and color balances. It’s important to read the caption for each image to better understand how color is being used to communicate an astronomical message. Compare how these images look to your image of UGC12635.</p>",
