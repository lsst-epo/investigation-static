They can only measure the amount of light that illuminates the <strong>image sensor</strong>.To build a color image, we use <strong>filters</strong>. A filter is designed to allow only certain wavelengths (or colors) of light to pass through it. All other wavelengths (or colors) are blocked. Figure 3a shows an example of how an orange filter <strong>transmits</strong> some wavelengths of light while blocking others.</p>",
