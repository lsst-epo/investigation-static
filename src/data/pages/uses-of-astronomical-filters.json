However, astronomers can make color images from the light transmitted by ultraviolet or infrared filters by assigning a color to the image taken through these filters. Filters that transmit light over a range of wavelengths from ultraviolet to visible to infrared are used to investigate objects or areas of interest. Here are some examples:</p><h2>Seeing through dust</h2> <p>Even though infrared wavelengths are invisible to the human eye, you can make color images from infrared light by assigning a color to the image taken through an infrared filter. The LSST Camera has three near-infrared filters: i, z, and y.</p><p>Near-infrared wavelengths of light are not as easily deflected by dust, unlike shorter visible wavelengths. Using these filters make it possible to see through some of the dust of a nebula, revealing hidden stars. These filters are also excellent for detecting very faint red stars, which give off more light in infrared wavelengths than in visible red light.</p><p>Let’s see how this works: The Trifid Nebula (M20) is a dense cloud of gas and dust. If the Trifid Nebula was observed using visible light alone, many of the stars within it would be hidden from view.</p>",

(There’s a particular reason that these colors are arranged in this order—more on this later.) Then the final full color image was color balanced.</p>",
