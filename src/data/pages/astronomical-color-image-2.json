However, as you just saw, if the slider for a filter is moved too far to the left or the right, that color in the image can be too strong or too weak for the image to be color balanced. To color balance an image, adjust the sliders so that the image communicates the information you want it to and looks pleasing to you. For instance, if you want to show the blue stars in a galaxy, you will need to balance the image so that it shows some blue stars. At the same time, using a contrasting color (such as red) can be helpful to show where the blue stars are not found.</p>",
