The first American alarm clock was created in 1787 by Levi Hutchins, successfully combining two functions into one device. Sixty years later, Frenchman Antoine Redier made it adjustable for the user to set the alarm time, and only in the 1940s, the first radio alarm clock was invented by James F. Reynolds.<br/>Credit: Rubin Observatory"
