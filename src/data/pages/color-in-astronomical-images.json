The image produced by the filter that transmits light with the shortest wavelengths must be matched to the color in the image that also has a shortest wavelength. For instance, you might assign the color blue to the g filter image. You would then assign the images made by filters that transmit longer wavelengths of light to colors that correspond with wavelengths longer than blue (like green and red).</p>",
