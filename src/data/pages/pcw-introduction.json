Currently, these tools have been applied specifically to formal classroom “investigations” for students in advanced middle school through college intro levels.</p><p>In the following 10 pages, we invite you to explore samples of these interactive widgets. We’d like to get your feedback on the tools (Are they fun?  Are they engaging?). We’d also like your help to generate use cases for how you might use these tools to communicate science to the general public. You can provide us feedback during the session on <a href='https://rubin2020pcw.slack.com/archives/C016QSVHMP1'  target='_blank'>the slack channel (#day4-thu-slot3b-epo)</a> and through <a href='https://forms.gle/CrsLpH95dtPxnHpc7' target='_blank'>this survey form</a>.</p><p>Please note that you can find links to 5 full draft investigations on <a href='https://project.lsst.org/meetings/rubin2020/agenda/session/education-and-public-outreach-interacting-data-browser' target='_blank'>our PCW session webpage</a>. These data-driven classroom investigations take 1-2 hours to fully complete, use Rubin's LSST data to explore a range of commonly-taught principles in astronomy and physics, and offer all the context necessary to use the tools featured in this session.</p><p>We hope you enjoy this exploration!</p>",
