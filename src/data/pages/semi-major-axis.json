By making a series of careful measurements, they can determine a preliminary orbit for the object. The orbit is mathematically expressed through a set of orbital elements.</p><p>The <b>semi-major axis</b> is half of the longest diameter of an ellipse. Simply put, this number indicates the size of the orbit. It is measured in <b>astronomical units</b> (au).</p>",
