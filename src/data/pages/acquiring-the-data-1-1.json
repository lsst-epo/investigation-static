A supernova explodes in a large galaxy once every 50 years, but with Rubin Observatory’s ability to monitor billions of galaxies, we can find 1000 supernovae every night!</p><p>Because supernovae often appear where no star was previously visible, they can be spotted by comparing images of the host galaxy taken at different times. The images on this page show a supernova discovered in a galaxy. Can you find it? When you spot the supernova, click on it.</p><p>When a Type Ia supernova explodes in a galaxy, we can use the peak luminosity of the supernova to determine the distance to the galaxy. And we can use the galaxy’s photometric redshift to determine its velocity away from us. With these two pieces of information, we can add the galaxy to a Hubble plot.</p>",
