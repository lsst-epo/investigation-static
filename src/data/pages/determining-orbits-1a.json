Astronomers are concerned if <i>any</i> of these possible orbits predict the an asteroid impact!</p><p>The probability of impact is calculated by dividing the number of possible orbits that result in the asteroid hitting Earth by the total number of possible orbits. After the first two observations of this asteroid were made, astronomers computed 3000 possible orbits of the asteroid (shown at the right). Of these, 10 orbits cross Earthâ€™s orbit and therefore have the potential for causing an impact with Earth.</p>",
