You will now see a set of data of the <a href='http://rubineducation.org/glossary/apparent-magnitude' target='_blank'>apparent magnitude</a> of the supernova taken over a series of days on the graph at the right. This is known as a <a href='http://rubineducation.org/glossary/light-curve' target='_blank'>light curve</a>. Advance through all of the images of the supernova and watch as the corresponding brightness of the supernova in the image matches a circled data point on the graph.</p>",
