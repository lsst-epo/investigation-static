In some cases this shifting to longer wavelengths can make the galaxies detectable only at infrared wavelengths.</p><p>To detect the infrared light from a distant galaxy, you need to be sure to use both a filter that passes infrared light from the galaxy and a filter that does not pass this infrared light. Next, compare the images created from these two filters and look for objects that appear only in the infrared. If you are trying to observe the most distant galaxies, whose light has been shifted to the longest wavelengths, use a filter that passes infrared light at the longest wavelengths (like the y filter).</p><p>In the full color image at the right, the long wavelength infrared light from distant galaxies (detected with z-filter) was colorized red, making it possible to quickly spot the distant galaxy as a red-orange color.</p>",
