To work with very large numbers of galaxies, astronomers use <i>concentration maps</i>.</p><p>Concentration maps use colors to represent how many galaxies are in a particular area. They are like population density maps. Areas of high population density show many people living in a relatively small area. <a target='_blank' href='http://luminocity3d.org/WorldPopDen/#3/12.00/10.00'>Look at this example</a>.</p>",
