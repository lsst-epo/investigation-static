But does this law apply only from our perspective in the Milky Way, or from other places in the Universe as well? To find out, let’s explore another Rubin Observatory data set.</p><p>We will begin by viewing the data for six galaxies observed from the Milky Way Galaxy.</p><p>Now click on different buttons to see what the Hubble plots would look like for astronomers living in other galaxies.</p>",
