The LSST Camera has three filters that can transmit some near infrared light: i, z, and y. Using these filters make it possible to see through some of the gas and dust of a nebula, revealing hidden stars. These filters are also excellent for detecting very faint red stars, which give off more light in near-infrared wavelengths than in visible red light.</p>",
