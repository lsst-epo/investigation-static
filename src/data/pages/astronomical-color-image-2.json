However, color balancing does not mean setting the same intensity for each filter. For instance, if you want to show the blue stars in a galaxy, you may want to increase the intensity of blue in the image. In summary, To color balance an image, adjust the sliders so that the image communicates the information you want it to and looks pleasing to you.</p><p>Now itâ€™s your turn to color balance galaxy M33. Adjust all the sliders until you are satisfied with the appearance of your image.</p>",
