This damage is due to the earthquake energy that travels along the surface of the Earth.</li><li>Airblast damage: Asteroid impacts produce a shock wave that moves through the air. This damage is due to the <strong>shock wave</strong> hitting structures or objects.</li></ul><p>You may select distances up to 20,000 km away, which is on the other side of Earth opposite the impact.</p>",
