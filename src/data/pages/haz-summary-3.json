Two different types of damage are predicted:</p><ul><li><strong>Seismic</strong> damage: Asteroid impacts produce earthquakes. This damage is due to the earthquake energy that travels along the surface of the Earth.</li><li>Airblast damage: Asteroid impacts produce a shock wave that moves through the air. This damage is due to the shock wave hitting structures or objects.</li></ul><p>You may select distances up to 20,000 km away, which is on the other side of Earth opposite the impact.</p>",
