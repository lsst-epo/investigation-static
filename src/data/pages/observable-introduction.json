  "content": "<p>We know the Universe is big, but how big is it? It's full of fascinating objects we can see, and a lot of things we can't. Does the Universe go on forever? Where are we in the Universe? These questions are profound, and not easily answered, but scientists at Rubin Observatory are using new tools to learn more.</p><p>To find answers to these cosmic questions, astronomers start by analyzing the light from distant objects. Astronomers create deep field images by pointing a telescope in a single direction in space and observing that area for long periods of time. This technique reveals millions of faraway galaxies that are otherwise too dim to be seen.</p><p>The LSST telescope and camera system is revolutionizing our view of the Universe by detecting billions of new galaxies in deep field images and calculating the distance to them. In this investigation, you will use the light from galaxies to develop an estimate for the size of the observable Universe, and to look back at different ages in the history of the Universe to see how its structure has changed over time.</p><h3>Essential Questions</h3><ul><li>How can observations of light from distant galaxies be used to determine some characteristics of the observable Universe, such as its minimum size, early history, and expansion?</li><li>How has the distribution of galaxies in the Universe (the <i>large-scale structure</i>) changed over time?</li><li>How do we know that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating?</li><li>What is the role of gravity in the evolution of the large-scale structure of the Universe?</li></ul>"
