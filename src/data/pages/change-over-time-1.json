Astronomers can measure the distance to billions of galaxies using data from LSST. Using the distances and position of galaxies astronomers can create a map of the observable Universe that reveals this large-scale structure. This structure is possible to see by viewing a concentration map of a region of the Universe.</p><p>Here is a sample galaxy concentration map. Examine the color legend at the map bottom. White areas of the map are places that LSST has not observed the sky.</p>",
