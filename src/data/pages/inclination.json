A value of 0° means that the object's orbit is parallel with Earth’s orbit. A value of 90° means that the object's orbit is tilted at a right angle to Earth’s orbit. If an object has an orbit with inclination greater than 90°, it will be orbiting in a direction opposite to Earth’s orbital direction.</p>",
