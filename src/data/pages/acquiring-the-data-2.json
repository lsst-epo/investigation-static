  "content": "<p>Over its ten-year survey, Rubin Observatory data will help astronomers determine the velocities of approximately three million supernovae by using a technique called photometric redshift. The brightness of a galaxy is measured through multiple filters. The brightness through each filter can be used to construct a graph to determine the galaxy’s redshift, and from the redshift we can determine how fast the galaxy is moving away from the Milky Way.</p><p>In summary: When a Type Ia supernova explodes in a galaxy, we can use that peak luminosity of the supernova to determine the distance to the galaxy. And we can use the galaxy’s photometric redshift to determine its velocity away from us. With these two pieces of information, we can add the galaxy to a Hubble plot.</p>"
