Two different types of damage are predicted:</p><ul><li><strong>Seismic</strong> damage: Asteroid impacts produce earthquakes. This damage is due to the energy that travels along the surface of the Earth.</li><li><strong>Air blast</strong> damage: Asteroid impacts produce a shock wave that moves through the air. This damage is due to the <strong>shock wave</strong> hitting structures or objects.</li></ul><p>You may select distances up to 20,000,000 meters away, which is on the other side of Earth opposite the impact. Note: to input a number in scientific notation, for example  1.2x107 , type 1.2e7.</p>",
