  "content": "<p>Rubin Observatory will discover millions of new Solar System objects, and will provide an enormous data set that gives us a more comprehensive view of the objectsâ€™ distribution. The more we know about the distribution and properties of objects in our Solar System, the more we understand about how it formed.</p><p>Most small Solar System objects we have discovered can be classified into four groups:<ul><li><b>Near-Earth objects</b> (NEOs) - Objects whose orbits intersect or get very close to the orbit of Earth.</li><li><b>Main Belt asteroids</b> (MBAs) - Objects that orbit the Sun between the orbits of Mars (1.5 au) and Jupiter (5.2 au).</li><li><b>Trans-Neptunian objects</b> (TNOs) - Objects with an orbital size of 30 au or larger. Typically TNOs orbit beyond Neptune, however some may periodically come closer to the Sun than Neptune.</li><li><b>Comets</b> - Icy objects found throughout the Solar System. When orbiting close to the Sun, they develop a head and a tail formed by escaping gas and dust.</li></ul></p>"
