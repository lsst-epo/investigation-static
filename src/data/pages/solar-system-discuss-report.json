Next, think about how hard it would be to travel to this asteroid from Earth. Traveling to an asteroid that is moving at a velocity similar to Earth’s would require less rocket fuel, so an NEO with an orbit most similar to Earth is optimal. Consider an asteroid’s orbital characteristics such as semi-major axis and eccentricity. Explain how you arrived at your answers."
