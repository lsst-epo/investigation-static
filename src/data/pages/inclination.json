A value of 0° means that the orbit is parallel with Earth’s orbit. A value of 90° means that the orbit is tilted at a right angle to Earth’s orbit. Sometimes a value between 90° and 180° is listed. These objects are in retrograde orbits around the Sun, orbiting in the opposite direction of most Solar System objects.</p>",
