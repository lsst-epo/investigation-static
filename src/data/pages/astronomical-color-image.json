It works in a similar way to the RGB mixing tool. We will use it to explore an image of M33, a spiral galaxy.</p><ul><li>Select M33 from the dropdown menu.</li><li>Turn on the u filter. You should see a greyscale image of M33.</li><li>Now click on the left side of the slider and select the color violet. You should now see the image turn violet. Do not adjust the slider.</li><li>Repeat for the remaining filters, assigning the colors in chromatic order.</li></ul><p><em>Note: If you have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors, you can substitute alternate colors; cyan and magenta are available for this purpose.</em></p><p>You now see a full color image of M33, made by combining the light from these six filters. For this image the sliders are automatically positioned so that the colors are properly balanced (in other words, you don’t see too much of one color.)</p><p>Now let’s see what happens when you move the sliders.</p><p>Move the slider next to the g filter all the way to the right.</p>",
