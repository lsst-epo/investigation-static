  "content": "<p>You will begin by investigating four images of galaxies that contain supernovae,  discovered by Rubin Observatory. While the supernova can be used to find the distance to the galaxy, the brightness of the galaxy image (measured over a range of wavelengths) can be used to determine the galaxyâ€™s redshift, which can be then used to calculate the recessional velocity of the galaxy.</p><p>The distances to the Type Ia supernovae and recessional velocities of the galaxies have already been determined. Your job is to find the supernovae and galaxy in each image. Later in this investigation you will use the data for your four galaxies to create a Hubble plot.</p><p>The distances to supernovae are measured in megaparsecs (Mpc). One megaparsec corresponds to a distance of roughly 3.3 million light years. Remember, because each supernova is in a galaxy, the distances to the supernova and the galaxy are the same. The recessional velocities of the galaxies are measured in kilometers per second (km/s).</p>",
