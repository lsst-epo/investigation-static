The distance is in megaparsecs (Mpc). One megaparsec corresponds to a distance of roughly 3.3 million light years. Remember, because the supernova is in the galaxy, the distances to the supernova and the galaxy are the same.</li><li>Identify the center of the galaxy by clicking on it. A yellow circle should appear when you have correctly located it.</li><li>Note that the galaxy velocity (moving away from Earth) appears in the green box at the top of the Galaxy Selector. The recessional velocity of the galaxy is in kilometers per second (km/s).</li><li>Once you have identified the supernova and galaxy,  the Hubble plot will slide out. Use the graph axes to find where on the graph corresponds to the velocity and distance of the galaxy. Click on the plot to add a dot at a location that is close to your measured values. (If you wish to reposition the dot, you can click in a different location). Click Save after you have placed the point.</li><li>Repeat this process for the Galaxies 2-4 by clicking the Next Galaxy button at the bottom of the Galaxy Selector. After you have plotted 4 points, go to the next page.</li></ol>",
