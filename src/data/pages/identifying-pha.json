They are called <a href='https://www.iau.org/public/themes/neo/nea2/' target='_blank'>Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)</a>. PHAs must meet these requirements:</p><ul><li>Their orbits must come within 0.05 AU of the orbit of Earth.</li><li>The objects must be at least 140m in diameter.</li></ul><p>If an asteroid comes within 0.05 AU of Earth, the gravitational attraction between the two objects becomes strong enough to alter the orbit of the asteroid so that it could hit Earth.</p><p>Itâ€™s important to note that, in the PHA definition, the distance of 0.05 AU is the distance between the orbits of Earth and asteroid at their closest approach, not the actual distance between Earth and the asteroid. </p>",
