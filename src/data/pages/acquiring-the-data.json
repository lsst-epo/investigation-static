  "content": "<p>In order to construct a Hubble plot, you need two pieces of information about each galaxy: its distance from Earth, and its recessional velocity (the speed at which it’s moving away from Earth).</p><p>One of the most difficult challenges for astronomers is to determine distances to faraway objects like galaxies. One way to measure the distance to a galaxy is to look for a certain type of supernova (an exploded star) called a Type Ia (pronounced “type one-a”) supernova that is located within the galaxy. Type Ia supernovae are useful because they can all be standardized to determine their true peak <a target='_blank' href='http://rubineducation.org/glossary/luminosity' target='_blank'>luminosity</a> no matter where they occur in the Universe. You can then use the peak luminosity to calculate the distance to the supernova. If you can measure the distance to a Type Ia supernova, then you also know the distance to the galaxy it resides in.</p><p>This picture shows a supernova that exploded in the galaxy M51. Notice that it is bright compared to the other stars in the galaxy, and even brighter than the core of the galaxy itself.</p><p>Supernovae are rare events. A supernova explodes in a large galaxy once every 50 years, but with Rubin Observatory’s ability to monitor billions of galaxies, we can find 1000 supernovae every night!</p>",
