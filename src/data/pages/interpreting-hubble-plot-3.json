A useful way to think about why galaxies appear to move away from each other is to think of galaxies fixed to a certain point in space, and that space is expanding. This causes galaxies to become farther apart from one another.</p><p>The relationship you have been exploring between a galaxy’s recessional velocity and its distance is known as the Hubble-Lemaitre Law.</p>",
