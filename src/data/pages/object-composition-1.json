The blue points show C-class and S-class asteroids when measured through Rubin Observatory’s g, r, i, and z filters. The x-axis shows four filters. The y-axis is a measure of brightness compared to the g filter. For example, if the r filter shows a brightness value of 3, it means that the asteroid appeared three times brighter through the r filter than it was when measured through the g filter.</p><p>The blue line shows the average values measured for each filter. For C-class asteroids the plot is relatively flat across the r, i, z filter range.  For S-class asteroids the plot increases from r to i filters but then decreases from i to z filters.</p><p>We are especially interested in the surface composition of NEOs, since they are the easiest objects to visit. Rubin Observatory has detected many new NEOs. The red curve on each plot shows the brightness data for one such asteroid.</p><p><em>When comparing this asteroid's brightness data to the C-class and S-class asteroids, don’t pay attention to the height of the curves but instead compare the shapes of the curves</em>.</p>",
