A supernova explodes in a large galaxy once every 50 years, but with Rubin Observatoryâ€™s ability to monitor billions of galaxies, we can find 1000 supernova every night!</p><p>Because supernovae often appear where no star was previously visible, they can be spotted by comparing images of the host galaxy taken at different times. The images on this page show a supernova discovered in a galaxy. Can you find it? When you spot the supernova, click on it.</p>",
