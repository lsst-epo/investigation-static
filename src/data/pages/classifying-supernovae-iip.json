  "content": "<p>One type of supernova happens when a high mass, main sequence star nears the end of its life. If the star has a mass more than eight times that of the Sun, its core will eventually collapse, causing it to explosively blow off its outer layers. If a supernova of this type stays bright for over 90 days, it is called a Type IIp (pronounced “type two-p”) supernova. Supernovae from high mass stars are not all the same brightness. The peak brightness of a Type IIp supernova depends on the mass of the star.</p>"
