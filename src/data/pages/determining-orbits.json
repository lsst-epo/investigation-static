Asteroids are discovered by detecting an object that has changed position in two or more pictures taken of a particular location in space. After the first night that it is discovered, additional observations need to be done to measure its speed and direction of motion.</p><p>Letâ€™s look at a typical newly-discovered asteroid. In the example below, asteroid WD5-A was discovered on 20 November 2007 and was observed again on 5 December and 19 December 2007. Each time, the position of the asteroid was measured</p>",
