The image obtained using the filter that transmits the light with the shortest wavelengths is colorized blue, and the one using the filter that transmits the light with the longest (infrared) wavelengths is colorized red. The color image in Figure 9 below was made by combining all three filtered images and shows the most distant galaxies in a very red color, because they are brightest at very long wavelengths.</p>",
