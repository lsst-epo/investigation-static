Once you have located the supernova and clicked on it, you will see a set of observations of the magnitude of the supernova at different times on the graph at the right. This is known as a light curve. Now advance through all of the other images of the supernova and watch as the corresponding magnitude of the supernova in the image is selected on the graph.</p>",
